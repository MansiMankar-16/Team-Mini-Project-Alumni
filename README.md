# Team-Mini-Project-Alumni
It's my college mini project where team size is 4 and assign one mentor to our team
The Alumni Management System project aims to develop a comprehensive and easy-to-use platform for managing the institution's alumni network. The system facilitates alumni to create and maintain their profiles, communicate with each other, and remain informed of the college's recent news and events. The system provides 2 sides of users UI, which are the admin side and the alumnus/alumna's side. The platform provides advanced features such as job opportunities posted by other alumni or admin, upcoming event management, and a discussion forum. We uses HTML, CSS Streamline for building Frontend. Python for backend. SQLite, MySQL & PHP for Database. Apache server to Host. Windows 8/10/11 for development and deployment.
